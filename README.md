# VyOS Contrib

Welcome to the VyOS Contrib organization! This is a place where we organize projects related to VyOS that are not officially affiliated with VyOS and have no connection to the company behind VyOS (vyos.io).

## About

Our organization is not formal; it is purely an effort by various volunteers who are passionate about VyOS. We aim to contribute and share useful projects and resources with the community.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of new projects. If you have a project that you would like to contribute, please submit a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/vyos-contrib/.github/issues) of our VyOS Contrib GitHub organization.

Thank you for your interest and contributions!
